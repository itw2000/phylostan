#Scripts
The scripts are in the R file as well the stan models are included in the repository. As long as the entire zipped repository is
downloaded and used as the working directory then the model should work on the included primates dataset. Just follow the instructions after installing the package or simply run each function in the script in order. The stan model does not provide meaninful results however.
